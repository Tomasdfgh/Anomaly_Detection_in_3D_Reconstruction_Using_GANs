# Anomaly Detection in 3D Reconstruction Using GANs

Anomaly detection is a critical task in machine
learning, where the goal is to identify instances
in data that deviate significantly from the norm.
This problem is particularly challenging in high dimensional spaces, such as those encountered
in 3D reconstruction, where traditional methods often struggle due to the complexity and
volume of data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool
for anomaly detection, particularly in scenarios
where abnormal data is scarce or hard to define.
GANs are capable of learning the distribution of
normal data and can be used to detect anomalies by assessing how well new data fits within
this learned distribution.
A GAN consists of two neural networks: a
generator, which creates data samples, and a
discriminator, which distinguishes between real
and generated samples. The generator aims to
produce samples indistinguishable from the real
data, while the discriminator learns to identify
which samples are real and which are generated.
This adversarial process encourages the generator to create increasingly realistic samples, effectively learning the underlying data distribution.
This paper builds on the method introduced
by Deecke et al. [1], who demonstrated the effectiveness of GANs for anomaly detection in
2D images. Their approach is extended in this paper to the domain of 3D reconstruction, focusing on the identification of anomalies in 3D
datasets. By leveraging the power of GANs, the
paperâ€™s aim is to develop a robust system for detecting anomalies in complex, high-dimensional
3D data, which could have significant implications for various applications such as quality
control in manufacturing, medical imaging, and
autonomous systems. Our approach adapts the
GAN framework to handle the unique challenges
posed by 3D data, providing a novel contribution to the field of anomaly detection.
